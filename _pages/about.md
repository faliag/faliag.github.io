Welcome to my website. I am a 5th-year PhD Candidate in Health Services Research at the [Department of Health Policy and Management](https://public-health.tamu.edu/degrees/hpm/index.html), [Texas A&M University School of Public Health](https://public-health.tamu.edu/index.html) with interests in **Climate Change and Health**. I am affiliated with  [Southwest Rural Health Research Cencer](https://srhrc.tamu.edu/index.html) at Texas A&M University. I conduct inter-disciplinary research at the intersection of environmental stressors, health policy, and social determinants of health to understand how these forces shape health equity and access to care for vulnerable populations. My research agenda connects health policy, health economics, public opinion, political behavior, health communication, rural health, and spatial epidemiology to examine how policy and environment jointly affect population health. I am on the **2025-2026 job market**.

Prior to Texas A&M University, I worked as a Primary Care Physician (PCP) in India and as a Lecturer (US Assistant Professor equivalent) in the Republic of Ireland. I received my MBBS (US MD equivalent) from West Bengal University of Health Sciences, India in 2014 and my MBA from [Trinity Business School](https://www.tcd.ie/business/) at [Trinity College, Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) in the Republic of Ireland in 2018. In my free time, I cook, travel, read and write poetry, and volunteer.

To learn more about my work, please view my [CV](/files/gfaliacvnovember2025.pdf). I am always open to collaborating with colleagues and mentoring students across disciplines and at all levels. Please reach out if you are interested in my research.
